      <description>&lt;p&gt;When it comes to tech, I view myself a &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_of_all_trades,_master_of_none&#34;&gt;generalist&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;: a person not excelling at anything specifically, but striving to grasp a wide spectrum of different things and looking at a general picture. Seeing the progress of the large language models, I believe people like me are going to be totally wiped out. Soon. Or, perhaps the 95% will, and the rest will be those lucky ones who managed to fight their way up to the not-exactly-cushy but better-than-totally-unskilled jobs of the AI-operators: be good enough to make a suitable prompt, check the results and stitch them together. It was &amp;ldquo;the glue&amp;rdquo; code, now it&amp;rsquo;s the glue humans.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
