      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just in a couple of days one of the biggest software events &lt;a href=&#34;https://fosdem.org&#34;&gt;FOSDEM 2021&lt;/a&gt; will take place, for the first time completely online. Hundreds of talks will originate from behind laptops, phones and workstations. Realization of this fact was the last link in the long chain of events leading to me writing this reference. Being a sound engineer by trade I, presumptuously, hope to attract attention of the speakers-to-be to the sound quality of their presentations. However, I tried to do my best to compile and present a generally useful reference, not a dumbed down step-by-step guide doomed to be rendered inapplicable by slightest variation of circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
